This one is for me; Mawjad | Here is a poem about Scheme:
<pre>
In the heart of MIT, a language born,
A Lisp named Scheme, in early morn.
Shimmering in parens, a beacon bright,
Casting on problems a new kind of light.

A textbook penned, a guide so grand,
"Structure and Interpretation" in every hand.
Abelson and Sussman, the authors wise,
On every page, a new surprise.

In the world of code, where logic reigns,
Scheme finds beauty in symbolic chains.
Each function a poem, each program a song,
In the symphony of Scheme, we all belong.

Recursion, abstraction, and first-class functions,
Scheme's elegance offers no obstructions.
Functional, imperative, with lexical scope,
In the vast universe of code, it's our hope.

The textbook teaches, with lessons so clear,
The heart of computation, far and near.
From data to procedure, in every chapter,
Unveiling the magic we're all after.

Gone are the days of rote memorization,
Welcome the era of true interpretation.
For a computer program is not just a tool,
But a work of art, from this wonderful school.

So here's to Scheme, and the textbook we revere,
Their lessons in our hearts, forever near.
In every line of code, in every algorithm's scheme,
We see their influence, like a dream.
